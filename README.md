# Library-database-management-system
Library Management System with PHP and MySQL  
Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an information
system application to support a library. You are required to use the Classical
Methodology for Database Development. The system should be implemented
using a relational DBMS that supports standard SQL queries. Class administrators
will provide you with information about how to access a college-managed MySQL
server in order to implement your database and the application. The professors
must approve any other alternative implementations. In no circumstances can you
use a tool that automatically generates SQL or automatically maps programming
objects into the database.
